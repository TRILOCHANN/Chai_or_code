## 4 pillars 
Abstraction //  it means hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object or function
Encapsulation  //  In JavaScript, encapsulation means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) that work on that data into a single unit, usually an object or a class
Inheritance // It allows code reusability and helps create hierarchies between classes or objects.
Polymorphism // usuwhere one function or method behaves differently based on the object that is calling it.
